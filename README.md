**StockViz** is an application which represents numerical stock data in a visual format.


**Technologies Used:**

- Ruby on Rails
- Yahoo! Finance Gem
- CSS/HTML
- JAVASCRIPT, AJAX, JSON, JQUERY


**Getting Started**

1. Create an account or login entering a username and password
2. enter a stock ticker symbol into the search bar.  When it brings back a result you will have an option to add it to your portfolio.  If you do not want to add a particular stock, you can make another query.
3. After adding a stock to your portfolio click a button to visualize the data. You can click this button at any time for an update if you add more stocks. 
4. If you click the PE Ratio button it will render a set of circles, each one representing a different stock.  The circles are color coded (RAG indicator): green for undervalued, amber for a reasonable valuation and red for overvalued; white indicates a PE ratio was N/A.
